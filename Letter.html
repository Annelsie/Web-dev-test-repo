    House of Representatives of Uganda</br>
    Office Address of Representatives of Senator.</br>
    Dear Senator <u>Mr. Natale Godfrey</u></br>

    <p>
        I am very fortunate to have been provided with an excellent education that prepared me for the future. I currently have children in both elementary and middle school. Recently, I have become very concerned about legislative impact on education. As a parent yourself, Iam sure that you share many of these concerns.

        “Ensuring a World Class Neutron Research Facility” in the proposed FY2016 Department of Commerce budget. My graduate studies involve research and development of functional inorganic materials, with the intent of developing the next generation of materials and products. A critical step in the progress of my research is characterization performed by neutron scattering, much of which I carry out at the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The technique of neutron scattering is uniquely suited to my studies and benefits many fields of science, not just materials research.

            Last year the decision was made to eliminate funding for the user program at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center. This decision directly impacted my research, as well as countless other graduate students and scientists. It also significantly weakened the United States’ impact in all of the areas benefited by neutron science. Without adequate funding for the NCNR, neutron users such as myself will be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our international counterparts. The requested additional funds will ensure that researchers in the United States will have access to the unique capabilities neutrons possess for studying materials and science problems. 
    </p>
    <p>
            I urgently request that you keep the budget increase that NCNR has received so it can fulfill and increase its mission objectives and impact, especially in supporting the education and development of the next generation of STEM talent.
    </p>

    Thank you</br>
